# Industry4OpsMgmt42382

This repository consists of group projects and my personal notes for the course 42382 Industry 4.0 in Operations Management at DTU in Fall 2023. The group project was done in a group of 3.

The topics are covered are as follows:

- Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems
- Predictive Maintenance
- Logistics: Warehousing & IoT
- Hospital of the Future
- Personnel Planning
- Operation Room Planning

Most of the work are linear programming problems solved using Julia (Gurobi, JuMP), Microsoft Excel, and a few using Python.
